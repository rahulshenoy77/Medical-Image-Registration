# Medical-Image-Registration

This work presents a convolutional neural network trained for image registration using a weakly supervised training scheme. While previous deep learning methods for image registration require image datasets with ground truth spatial transformations, the present work relies only on anatomical labeling as the ground truth, datasets of which are more readily available. Anatomical labels may be of organs, blood vessels, tumors, or other ad hoc structures. The proposed method requires anatomical labels for training, but inference may be performed with unlabeled image pairs of the same modality as the training pairs. A key advantage is the speed of inference in this method, because previous neural network-based methods required training and optimization for each image pair in order to do registration. Magnitude-based parameter pruning and quantization are applied to the final model to make it more amenable to hardware-based acceleration.
